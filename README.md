## Story Behind Masari
### Built by Students for Students
We understand how overwhelming it can feel to choose the right path for your academic future. With so many options, opinions, and sources of information, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. That’s exactly why Masari was created to simplify the process, give you clarity, and provide the right tools and insights you need to make confident, informed decisions about your education.
